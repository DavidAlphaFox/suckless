## alpha

Alpha allows transparency, but breaks w3m-image preview functionality.

## newterm

Something with my dwm doesn't allow this to work, need to research.

## single-buffering

This used to be needed to allow w3m-image to work, but now st-w3m patch is
a much better solution. Saving for historical purposes in case its useful
for anything later.
