## Building

`./build.sh $name`

note: `dwm` has not yet been cleaned up to work with build.sh, it will be a while.

These are using my `config.h` and `config.mk` in the `config` dir of each folder.  
Note... These are more for reference, don't expect them to just compile.

If you get color array errors, it's because I use `pywal` and my config.h tries to pull those colors in.  
If you do not have `~/.cache/wal` then you'll need to add those colors to the config.h's manually.

For any questions, feel free to contact me or open a git issue.
